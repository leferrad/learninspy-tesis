* Introduction

GlossTeX is a tool for the automatic preparation of glossaries, lists
of acronyms and sorted lists in general for use with LaTeX and
MakeIndex. In order to build GlossTeX, you need an ANSI C
compiler.

GlossTeX in some kind combines the functionality of acronym, nomencl
and GloTeX. Like GloTeX, it uses the same format glossary definition
files. GlossTeX can be used together with nomencl, nevertheless.

A term consists of a label which is used to identify it, an optional
typeset representation, an optional long-form (e.g. when it's an
acronym) and the actual text describing it. These elements can all be
accessed in several ways within the document. It is also possible to
place cross-references from one term to another and include
page-references into the produced lists. You can produce as many
independent lists as you like.

The most recent official release can always be found on
CTAN:/support/glosstex. Inofficial development releases may be found
on my homepage at http://webrum.uni-mannheim.de/ba/yavuzv/.

GlossTeX comes with absolutely no warranty and is covered by the GNU

* Usage

In your LaTeX-source, type:


	\documentclass{article}
	\usepackage{glosstex}
	\begin{document}

	\printglosstex(acr)
	This document is typeset using \gls{LaTeX}.

	The database file\glosstex{gdf-file} for use with
	\gls{GlossTeX} is a flat \ac{ASCII} file.

	\printglosstex(glo)
	\end{document}

You need a .gdf-file that contains the definitions of the terms you
want to appear in the glossary. For example:

	@entry{LaTeX, \LaTeX{}} \LaTeX{} is a \TeX{}-format.

	@entry{ASCII, ASCII, American Standard Code for Information
	Interchange} ASCII is a character encoding. See also
	\glxref{EBCDIC}.


You then run latex, glosstex, makeindex and latex again to build the
glossary. It may be necessary to use up to 4 iterations until all
references are resolved.
