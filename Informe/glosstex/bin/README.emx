This is the readme file for the OS/2 binary of Volkan Yavuz's glosstex.
The latest distribution with the sources, makefile (also for OS/2) and
documentation can always be found at the CTAN site near you, for
instance:

	ftp.tex.ac.uk	and	ftp.dante.de

and a boatload of mirrors out there like wcarchive.cdrom.com etc.

The binary was built using gcc version 2.7.1 from the emx09c development
package by Eberhard Mattes. The used installation is at emxfix level 2.
So, in order to run the code you will need at least the emx runtime
library contained in emxrt.zip. 

You may well have that already when you have Eberhard Mattes excellent
emTeX implementation installed. Otherwise get the file emxrt.zip for
instance from ftp-os2.nmsu.edu (hobbes) or ftp-os2.cdrom.com (walnut
creek archive) or ftp.leo.org (LEO archive in Munich, Germany) and
install it according to its readme.

There are two executables in the bin directory, simply rename the one
you are going to use to glosstex.exe and move it in a directory in your
PATH:

-rwxa--    65540 Feb  6 00:40 bin/glossteu-i386-os2-4.0.exe*
-rwxa--    44127 Feb  6 00:40 bin/glosstex-i386-os2-4.0.exe*

The first one is already stripped to reduce its size and runs fine on
OS/2 Warp 3 and Warp 4 and has a good chance to work on OS/2 2.x as
well. It should even work on DOS and, using the rsx DOS extender,
probably even on Windoze (3.1/95/NT). I haven't tested those though and
frankly, I don't really care. It doesn't on CP/M either. 

The second binary has been compressed using LXLite version 1.14 which
saves about 20 kB of its size, while keeping all of its functionality.
This is the one I use here. However, it will probably not run on OS/2
2.x (since support for executable compression was introduced in Warp 3)
and it is almost certain that it won't run on Mickey$oft DOG nor on
Micro$loth Winbloats anymore, even when using the rsx extender. I don't
think that that will matter much since bloated software fits the mindset
of M$ and its customers better anyway.

So, have fun, and just in case: The copyright and disclaimers of the
original glosstx distribution apply, you use this at your own risk and
no warranties, explicit or implied are given.

Note that glossteu.exe (rename it to glosstex.exe) will also run under
vanilla DOG and in OS/2 and a M$ DOG-box using rsx and emxrt,
respectively. They can be found on CTAN, too:

	tex/systems/msdos/dpmigcc/rsx...zip	for DOG-boxes
	tex/systems/msdos/emtex/emxrsx.zip	for DOG-boxes
	tex/systems/os2/web2c-6.1/binary/emxrt	for OS/2 and vanilla DOG
